# CodeJourney

This repository organizes some of the projects I develop during my learning process. The projects here remain true to the originals provided by the platforms and courses I use to enhance my skills. To explore codes I have created myself or those that have featured significant modifications from the originals, please visit my other repositories.

You can also check out my [programming-exercises](https://github.com/onogabriela/programming-exercises) and my [codewars-solutions](https://github.com/onogabriela/codewars-solutions) to track my progress in studying.
